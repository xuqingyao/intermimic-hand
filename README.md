## 🏠 Overview
<div align="center">
  <img src="assets/teaser.png" width="100%" alt="InterMimic teaser"/>
</div>

> **InterMimic** features **one** unified policy, spanning **diverse full-body interactions** with **dynamic, heterogeneous objects**—and it works out-of-the-box for both **SMPL-X** and **Unitree G1** humanoids.


## 📹 Demo

## 🔥 News
- **[2025-06-10]** Release the instruction for the student policy inference.
- **[2025-06-03]** Initial release of PSI and the processed data. Next release: teacher policy inference for [dynamics-aware retargeting](InterAct/OMOMO_retarget), and student policy inference.
- **[2025-05-26]** It's been a while! The student policy training pipeline has been released! The PSI and other data construction pipelines will follow soon.
- **[2025-04-18]** Release a checkpoint with high‑fidelity physics and enhanced contact precision.
- **[2025-04-11]** The training code for teacher policies is live—try training your own policy!
- **[2025-04-05]** We're excited by the overwhelming interest in humanoid robot support and are ahead of schedule in open-sourcing our Unitree-G1 integration—starting with a small demo with support for G1 with its original three-finger dexterous hands. Join us in exploring whole-body loco-manipulation with humanoid robots!
- **[2025-04-04]** InterMimic has been selected as a CVPR Highlight Paper 🏆. More exciting developments are on the way!
- **[2025-03-25]** We’ve officially released the codebase and checkpoint for teacher policy inference demo — give it a try! ☕️  

## 📖 Getting Started

### Dependencies

Follow the following instructions: 

1. Create new conda environment and install pytorch:

    ```bash
    conda create -n intermimic python=3.8
    conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio pytorch-cuda=11.6 -c pytorch -c nvidia
    pip install -r requirement.txt
    ```

    You may also build from [environment.yml](environment.yml), which might contain redundancies,
    ```bash
    conda env create -f environment.yml
    ```

2. Download and setup [Isaac Gym](https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac-gym). 

3. Download the [dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/141YoPOd2DlJ4jhU2cpZO5VU5GzV_lm5j/view?usp=sharing), unzip it, and move the extracted folder to `InterAct/OMOMO_new/`. *This build contains minor fixes to the original release, so your results may deviate slightly from those reported in the paper.*


4. Activate the environment:

    ```bash
    conda activate intermimic
    ```

### Data Replay


To replay the groud truth data, execute the following commands:

  ```bash
  sh scripts/data_replay.sh
  ```

*Note*: The output colors represent the ground truth contact markers for links.

### Teacher Policy Training


To train a teacher policy, execute the following commands:

  ```bash
  sh scripts/train_teacher.sh
  ```

A higher‑fidelity simulation enough for low-dynamic interaction (trading off some efficiency for realism):

  ```bash
  sh scripts/train_teacher_new.sh
  ```

**How to enable PSI**

Open the training config, for example, [`omomo_train_new.yaml`](./intermimic/data/cfg/omomo_train_new.yaml). Set

   ```yaml
   physicalBufferSize: <integer greater than 1>
   ```

**When to skip PSI**

OMOMO subjects `sub1`, `sub11`, `sub12`, and `sub13` include wrong flipped-hand frames that can push the motion out of bounds and stall the simulator. For those four subjects, leave `physicalBufferSize` at its default value (`1`) and train without PSI.

### Student Policy Training


To train a student policy with distillation, execute the following commands:

  ```bash
  sh scripts/train_student.sh
  ```

### Teacher Policy Inference


We’ve released a checkpoint for one (out of 17) teacher policy on OMOMO, along with some sample data. To get started:

1. Download the [checkpoints](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1biDUmde-h66vUW4npp8FVo2w0wOcK2_k?usp=sharing) and place them in the current directory.
2. Then, run the following commands:

    ```bash
    sh scripts/test_teacher.sh
    ```

3. Run the high‑fidelity modeling (trading off some efficiency for realism):

    ```bash
    sh scripts/test_teacher_new.sh
    ```

4. 🔥 To try it on the Unitree G1 with its three-fingered dexterous hand—directly learned from MoCap without any external retargeting:

    ```bash
    sh scripts/test_g1.sh
    ```

### Student Policy Inference


After finish the student policy training, run the inference with

  ```bash
  sh scripts/test_student.sh
  ```

## 📝 TODO List  
- [x] Release inference demo for the teacher policy  
- [x] Add support for Unitree-G1 with dexterous robot hands
- [x] Release training pipeline for the teacher policy 
- [x] Release student policy distillation training
- [x] Release processed MoCap
- [x] Release inference pipeline for the student policy 
- [ ] Distilled reference data (physically correct HOI data❗️), and all related checkpoints   
- [ ] Release all data and processing scripts alongside the [InterAct](https://github.com/wzyabcas/InterAct) launch  
- [ ] Release physics-based text-to-HOI and interaction prediction demo
